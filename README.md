Welcome to **Generative AI for Beginners .NET**, the hands-on course for .NET developers diving into the world of Generative AI!

This isn’t your typical “here’s some theory, good luck” course. This repository is all about **real-world applications** and **live coding** to empower .NET developers to take full advantage of Generative AI.

This is **hands-on**, **practical**, and designed to be **fun**!

Don't forget to [star (🌟) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it easier later.

➡️Get your own copy by [Forking this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Generative-AI-for-beginners-dotnet/fork) and find it next in your own repositories.

## ✨ What's New!

We're constantly improving this course with the latest AI tools, models, and practical samples:

- **New: Foundry Local demos!**
  - Lesson 3 now features hands-on demos for [Foundry Local models](https://github.com/microsoft/Foundry-Local/tree/main).
  - See the official docs: [Foundry Local documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/)
  - **Full explanation and code samples are available in [03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/06-LocalModelRunners.md](./03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/06-LocalModelRunners.md)**

- **New: Azure OpenAI Sora Video Generation Demo!**
  - Lesson 3 now features a hands-on demo showing how to generate videos from text prompts using the new [Sora video generation model](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/video-generation) in Azure OpenAI.
  - The sample demonstrates how to:
    - Submit a video generation job with a creative prompt.
    - Poll for job status and download the resulting video file automatically.
    - Save the generated video to your desktop for easy viewing.
  - See the official docs: [Azure OpenAI Sora video generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/video-generation)

- **New: Azure OpenAI Image Generation Model (`gpt-image-1`)**: Lesson 3 now features code samples for using the new Azure OpenAI image generation model, `gpt-image-1`. Learn how to generate images from .NET using the latest Azure OpenAI capabilities.
  - See the official: [How to use Azure OpenAI image generation models](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/dall-e?tabs=gpt-image-1) and [openai-dotnet image generation guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-dotnet?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-generate-images) for more details.
  - Find the sample in [Lesson 3: Core Generative AI Techniques .. /src/ImageGeneration-01.csproj](./03-CoreGenerativeAITechniques/src/ImageGeneration-01/ImageGeneration-01.csproj).

- **New Scenario: Concurrent Agent Orchestration in eShopLite**: The [eShopLite repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/eShopLite/tree/main/scenarios/07-AgentsConcurrent) now features a scenario demonstrating concurrent agent orchestration using Semantic Kernel. This scenario showcases how multiple agents can work in parallel to analyze user queries and provide valuable insights for future analysis.

## 🚀 Introduction

Generative AI is transforming software development, and .NET is no exception. This course aims to simplify the journey by offering:

- Short 5-10 minute videos for each lesson.
- Fully functional .NET code samples you can run and explore.
- Integration with tools like **GitHub Codespaces** and **GitHub Models** for seamless setup and fast time-to-code. But if you want to run the samples locally with your own models, you can totally do that too.

You'll learn how to implement Generative AI into .NET projects, from basic text generation to building full-fledged solutions using **GitHub Models**, **Azure OpenAI Services** and **local models with Ollama**.

## 📦 Each Lesson Includes

- **Short Video**: A quick overview of the lesson (5-10 minutes).
- **Complete Code Samples**: Fully functional and ready to run.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Simple instructions to help you learn and implement the concepts.
- **Deep Dive References**: This course focuses on the practical implementation of GenAI, to get deeper into the theoretical we also provide links to explanations in [Generative AI for Beginners - A Course](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) when needed.
