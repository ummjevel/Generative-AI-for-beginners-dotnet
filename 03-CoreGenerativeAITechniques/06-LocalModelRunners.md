## Sample Code: Using AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code with .NET

The AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code provides a way to run AI models locally on your machine. We have two examples that demonstrate how to interact with AI Toolkit models using .NET:

### 1. Semantic Kernel with AI Toolkit

The [AIToolkit-01-SK-Chat](./src/AIToolkit-01-SK-Chat/) project shows how to use Semantic Kernel to chat with a model running via AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

```csharp
// Example code demonstrating AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code with Semantic Kernel integration
// Configure to use a locally installed model through AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code
var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
builder.AddAzureOpenAIChatCompletion(
    modelId: modelId,
    endpoint: new Uri(endpoint),
    apiKey: apiKey);
var kernel = builder.Build();
```

### 2. Microsoft Extensions for AI with AI Toolkit

The [AIToolkit-02-MEAI-Chat](./src/AIToolkit-02-MEAI-Chat/) project demonstrates how to use Microsoft Extensions for AI to interact with AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code models.

```csharp
// Example code demonstrating AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code with MEAI
OpenAIClientOptions options = new OpenAIClientOptions();
options.Endpoint = new Uri(endpoint);
ApiKeyCredential credential = new ApiKeyCredential(apiKey);
// Create a chat client using local model through AI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code
ChatClient client = new OpenAIClient(credential, options).GetChatClient(modelId);
```

## Sample Code: Using Docker Models with .NET

In this repository, we have two examples that demonstrate how to interact with Docker-based models using .NET:

### 1. Semantic Kernel with Docker Models

The [DockerModels-01-SK-Chat](./src/DockerModels-01-SK-Chat/) project shows how to use Semantic Kernel to chat with a model running in Docker.

```csharp
var model = "ai/deepseek-r1-distill-llama";
var base_url = "http://localhost:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1";
var api_key = "unused";

// Create a chat completion service
var builder = Kernel.CreateBuilder();
builder.AddOpenAIChatCompletion(modelId: model, apiKey: api_key, endpoint: new Uri(base_url));
var kernel = builder.Build();

var chat = kernel.GetRequiredService<IChatCompletionService>();
var history = new ChatHistory();
history.AddSystemMessage("You are a useful chatbot. Always reply in a funny way with short answers.");

// ... continue with chat functionality
```

### 2. Microsoft Extensions for AI with Docker Models

The [DockerModels-02-MEAI-Chat](./src/DockerModels-02-MEAI-Chat/) project demonstrates how to use Microsoft Extensions for AI to interact with Docker-based models.

```csharp
var model = "ai/deepseek-r1-distill-llama";
var base_url = "http://localhost:12434/engines/llama.cpp/v1";
var api_key = "unused";

OpenAIClientOptions options = new OpenAIClientOptions();
options.Endpoint = new Uri(base_url);
ApiKeyCredential credential = new ApiKeyCredential(api_key);

ChatClient client = new OpenAIClient(credential, options).GetChatClient(model);

// Build and send a prompt
StringBuilder prompt = new StringBuilder();
prompt.AppendLine("You will analyze the sentiment of the following product reviews...");
// ... add more text to the prompt

var response = await client.CompleteChatAsync(prompt.ToString());
Console.WriteLine(response.Value.Content[0].Text);
```

## Sample Code: Using Foundry Local with .NET

This repository includes two demos for Foundry Local:

history.AddSystemMessage("You are a useful chatbot. Always reply in a funny way with short answers.");

var settings = new OpenAIPromptExecutionSettings
{
    MaxTokens = 50000,
    Temperature = 1
};

while (true)
{
    Console.Write("Q: ");
    var userQuestion = Console.ReadLine();
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(userQuestion))
    {
        break;
    }
    history.AddUserMessage(userQuestion);

    var responseBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    Console.Write("AI: ");
    await foreach (var message in chat.GetStreamingChatMessageContentsAsync(history, settings, kernel))
    {
        responseBuilder.Append(message.Content);
        Console.Write(message.Content);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();

    history.AddAssistantMessage(responseBuilder.ToString());
}
```

using System.Text;

var model = "Phi-3.5-mini-instruct-cuda-gpu";
var baseUrl = "http://localhost:5273/v1";
var apiKey = "unused";

OpenAIClientOptions options = new OpenAIClientOptions();
options.Endpoint = new Uri(baseUrl);
ApiKeyCredential credential = new ApiKeyCredential(apiKey);

ChatClient client = new OpenAIClient(credential, options).GetChatClient(model);

// here we're building the prompt
StringBuilder prompt = new StringBuilder();
prompt.AppendLine("You will analyze the sentiment of the following product reviews. Each line is its own review. Output the sentiment of each review in a bulleted list and then provide a generate sentiment of all reviews. ");
prompt.AppendLine("I bought this product and it's amazing. I love it!");
prompt.AppendLine("This product is terrible. I hate it.");
prompt.AppendLine("I'm not sure about this product. It's okay.");
prompt.AppendLine("I found this product based on the other reviews. It worked for a bit, and then it didn't.");

// send the prompt to the model and wait for the text completion
var response = await client.CompleteChatAsync(prompt.ToString());

// display the response
Console.WriteLine(response.Value.Content[0].Text);
```
