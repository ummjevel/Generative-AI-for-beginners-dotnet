#### What you'll learn in this lesson:

- 🌟 LLM completions and chat flows
- 🔗 Functions & plugins with LLMs
- 🔎 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- 👀 Vision-based AI approaches
- 🔊 Audio creation and transcription
- 🖼️ Image generation with DALL-E
- 🧩 Agents & assistants
- 💻 Running models locally with AI Toolkit and Docker

For this lesson, we will subdivide the content into the following sections:

- [Chat, LLM completions, and function calling](./01-lm-completions-functions.md)
- [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](./02-retrieval-augmented-generation.md)
- [Vision and audio AI applications](./03-vision-audio.md)
- [Image Generation with Azure OpenAI](./05-ImageGenerationOpenAI.md)
- [Agents](04-agents.md)
- [Running models locally with AI Toolkit, Docker, and Foundry Local](./06-LocalModelRunners.md)

Starting with Language Model completions and Chat applications and function implementations with language models in .NET.
